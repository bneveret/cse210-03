#Jumper game
Jumper is a hangman look alike with a character model with a parachute instead of a rope. A user guesses letter by 
letter to guess a specified random word. If the user cannot guess the word before the parachute is gone than the user loses. 
If the user can guess all the words before the parachute is gone he wins.

## Getting Started

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
